        <p>The dream is simple: use Cursor Cloud Agents to code while you sleep.</p>

<p>Or, more realistically in my case last Friday, while walking to the pub.</p>

<p>I wrote about my first pass at this recently in <a href="/cursor-agents/">Cursor Agents</a>. That worked, but there was still friction. I could ask an agent to make changes, but then I still had to pull the branch on my laptop and run everything locally to see if it actually worked.</p>

<p>That was fine for occasional use, but not exactly the “mobile-first, slightly chaotic, get stuff done from anywhere” workflow I was aiming for.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/robocop-cloud-agents-placeholder.svg" alt="Temporary Robocop placeholder image" /></p>

<p>Until I swap in the real image, please imagine Robocop quietly reviewing PR previews while I nap.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-upgrade-deploy-previews-from-agent-created-prs">The big upgrade: deploy previews from agent-created PRs</h2>

<p>Next step was getting Cloud Agents to set up GitHub deploy previews for pull requests using GitHub Actions. This was a massive quality-of-life improvement.</p>

<p>Here is the workflow it created: <a href="https://github.com/pxg/petegraham.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-preview.yml">Deploy PR preview workflow</a>.</p>

<p>Now when an agent opens a PR, I can review the code and the live preview without needing to run anything locally first. That closes a huge loop for me.</p>

<p>Before this, “reviewing” meant reading diffs and guessing.
Now reviewing means opening the preview on my phone and seeing what actually happened.</p>

<h2 id="the-bit-that-feels-like-the-future">The bit that feels like the future</h2>

<p>The most impressive part of Cursor Cloud Agents is the VM setup and testing workflow.</p>

<p>It does not just edit files and hope for the best. It can run checks, test the change, and even record videos of manual walkthroughs. That means I can ask for design tweaks, then watch proof of what changed, while I am on mobile.</p>

<p>That is peak (or peek) future energy.</p>

<p>Part man. Part machine. Part CI pipeline.</p>

<p>This website is where this feels most obvious. If I ask for a navigation tweak or spacing change, I can review the result in a desktop-style preview and artifact video from my iPhone. No remote desktop hacks. No SSH gymnastics. No “I’ll check later when I’m back at my laptop.”</p>

<h2 id="iphone-workflow-very-close-not-perfect">iPhone workflow: very close, not perfect</h2>

<p>This is already very good.</p>

<p>Still, I would love a proper native iPhone app experience for the Cursor Cloud Agent workflow, especially around reviewing diffs, previews and artifacts in one smooth flow.</p>

<p>The GitHub mobile app helps a lot, but there is still some tab-hopping and minor faff between tools.</p>

<p>Homepage review from an iPhone is now genuinely practical though, which was not true for me a few months ago.</p>

<h2 id="what-works-for-me-and-what-does-not">What works (for me) and what does not</h2>

<h3 id="1-work-in-small-increments">1) Work in small increments</h3>

<p>Cloud Agents are very good most of the time, but you get better results with tighter scope.</p>

<p>Small prompts. Small PRs. Quick feedback loops.</p>

<p>If I try to bundle too much in one go, quality drops and review gets harder.</p>

<h3 id="2-if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-badly-is-useful-here">2) “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing badly” is useful here</h3>

<p>I mean this in the best possible way.</p>

<p>Get the rough version done first. Then iterate.</p>

<p>Cloud Agents are fantastic at accelerating that loop: draft, test, review, tweak. You can polish after you know the shape is right.</p>

<h3 id="3-usage-limits-are-real">3) Usage limits are real</h3>

<p>If you run lots of agents, you will find the limits.</p>

<p>I definitely have.</p>

<p>At one point it felt like Robocop got paused by rate limits and had to file paperwork before protecting the repo.</p>

<p>One useful proxy number from this repo: I have already merged 10 Cursor-generated PRs since starting this experiment in early February. That is enough volume to feel both the magic and the limits.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-am-trying-next">What I am trying next</h2>

<p>The next experiment is building an app with Cursor Cloud Agents rather than just iterating on a website.</p>

<p>I also want to try more plugins/tools in that workflow, including the credit-card-related one, to see where the practical boundaries are right now.</p>

<p>My current take: this is already useful, already weirdly good on mobile, and still early. The workflow is not perfect, but it is absolutely heading in the right direction.</p>
