        <h1>Writing on an iPhone</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="post-body">
        <p>As I’ve previously written, <a href="/writing/">I want to do more writing this year</a>. As an experiment, I’m going to try writing in different locations. I don’t always want to carry a laptop, so I’ve been researching keyboards that work with iPhones. This may sound like madness, but it is something I’ve tried before and found surprisingly effective.</p>

<h2 id="iphone-bluetooth-keyboards">iPhone Bluetooth Keyboards</h2>
<p>Previously, I was using a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Keys-To-Go-Keys-to-Go/dp/B07W7K8MW2/">Keys to Go Bluetooth keyboard</a>, which <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/06/20/cool-tools-for-travel/">Tim Ferriss</a> recommended on his podcast a long time ago. I rate these little keyboards, but sadly, some keys on mine have gone (no pun intended).</p>

<p>I decided to switch to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07BNB6R7G">MoKo Universal Foldable Keyboard</a> recommended by <a href="http://blog.geekmanager.co.uk/category/recommendations/kit/">Meri Williams</a> instead. It weighs 176 grams, which is even lighter than the Keys to Go at 180 grams. It has some nice travel on the keys, but doesn’t have the iPhone-specific buttons (to get the home screen, etc), which is a shame but not the end of the world. Below is a photo of my cat Buzz with both keyboards, the Moko is on the left.</p>

<h2 id="iphone-writing-apps">iPhone Writing Apps</h2>
<p>The next thing is which app to write in. I went to use SimpleNote for simplicity, but found the font was too small when using the keyboard, and it’s not easily adjustable.</p>

<p>I’ve now settled on <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, which works nicely but does have some slightly strange behaviour in terms of scrolling when typing. Also, I find you need to pump the font up on mobile, which also increases it on desktop, if you’re using the same account.</p>

<h2 id="focus-time">Focus Time</h2>
<p>A weird side effect I noticed is that, because it’s actually more fiddly to multitask on an iPhone with an external keyboard, I find myself focusing on writing more than I do on a laptop. Makes me think that there’s a lot of potential in products that purposely limit distractions; this feels like it merits its own future article.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>I’ll continue to update on how my writing experiments play out.</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h2>
<p>After writing this, I was surprised to find that the iPhone also supports the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/mxck3b/a/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb-c-british-english">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>, which I already own, so I’m planning to experiment with this as well.</p>
