        <h1>Magic Keyboard on iPhone</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="post-body">
        <p><a href="/writing/">I want to do more writing this year</a> and have been <a href="/iphone-writing/">experimenting with iPhone compatible Bluetooth keyboards</a> for an ultra portable writing set up. Recently I discovered that the iPhone has surprising good support for Apple’s Magic Keyboard,  likely because there’s a popular iPad version which doubles as a case which has led to good iOS support.</p>

<p>In a way, using Apple’s Magic Keyboard with an iPhone is the dream combination. I love the layout, as it’s the same as the MacBook keyboard. I’ve used MacBooks for years, so this avoids any of the awkwardness with adjusting to a slightly different layout.</p>

<p>Now I already own a Bluetooth Magic Keyboard, I bought it originally to use with my MacBook, basically I never ended up using it because I much prefer the positioning of the trackpad under the keyboard on the MacBook rather than positioning a trackpad at the side. <a href="#macbook-external-keyboard-and-trackpad-rant">I’ve written a rant about this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pairing">Pairing</h2>
<p>The keyboard is easy to pair with the iPhone; you just need to switch it on and make sure it’s not paired with any other devices. Out of the box, the media keys support iOS shortcuts, which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>The main thing I found myself using to switch apps is that you can get Spotlight with Command + Space and then use this to launch the app you want.</p>

<h2 id="weight-and-portability">Weight and Portability</h2>
<p>The weight is actually pretty low at 243 g, so not that much more than travel Bluetooth keyboards. My main concern would be about chucking it in a bag without a case, as it’s a fairly expensive keyboard.</p>

<p>Also, size-wise, you are going to need a small bag, compared to a folding keyboard, which you could put in your pocket. Below are photos of the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07BNB6R7G">Moko folding keyboard</a> I own for comparison. Below is a size comparison of the keyboards with the Moko, unfolded there’s not a huge difference in size.</p>

<p>The advantage of the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07BNB6R7G">MoKo Foldable Keyboard</a> is it’s protected when it’s folded, so you don’t need a sleeve or case to stop it getting damaged. Below is a size comparison wit the folded keyboard, I’ve also included an iPhone 12 for scale.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>
<p>I’m going to try using it for a week or so, then decide which Bluetooth keyboard to settle on using with my iPhone.</p>

<p>I’ve ordered a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0F4KLMCVP">case</a> for popping the keyboard in a bag and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0FKSKJH3M">portable stand</a> to get the iPhone to a better height so I don’t get neck ache.</p>

<h2 id="details-on-controls">Details on Controls</h2>
<p>Here are details on controlling your iPhone using the Magic Keyboard and shortcuts.</p>

<p>To get to the home screen, you can type Globe + H. F3 shows you all your open apps, but I haven’t found a way to select the one I want without interacting with the touchscreen yet.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, I found Command + Space for Spotlight to search for apps was the best way to switch.</p>

<p>You can enable full keyboard access/controls, which lets you navigate the iPhone almost completely using the keyboard. Whilst this sounds cool, I found it was actually a bit fiddly and reduced my productivity, so I switched it off.</p>

<h2 id="macbook-external-keyboard-and-trackpad-rant">Macbook External Keyboard and Trackpad Rant</h2>
<p>You can attempt to achieve this with an external keyboard and trackpad, but it doesn’t work as nicely for a number of reasons: The top of the trackpad is higher than the bottom of the keyboard, so you need to rig something up so they sit at the same height.</p>

<p>You can buy devices to do this on Etsy, I also made one at home as a test. However, even with this, the Apple external trackpad has an annoying setting where it doesn’t disable while you’re typing, causing the cursor to move on screen. This is a known issue and different from how the built-in trackpad and keyboard work, rant over.</p>
