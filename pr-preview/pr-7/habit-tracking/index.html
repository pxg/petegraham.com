        <h1>Habit Tracking</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="post-body">
        <p>I want to establish habits such as getting up at the same time every weekday and having a regular meditation practice. These are things I know make me feel better, but I haven’t been doing consistently recently.</p>

<p>I decided a habit tracker would be useful to help me achieve this. From a motivation point of view, being able to track things visually helps me stick to them. I tried a number of the apps on the App Store, but found they were overly complex and were very naggy about trying to sign me up to the premium version.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I decided to start with a simple solution of tracking in a Google Sheet. The sheet is very simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>One day per row. <a href="/TIL/highlight_today_in_google_sheets/">Highlight the current day</a>. Hide all rows which aren’t the current week</li>
  <li>One habit per column</li>
  <li>A checkbox for completing the habit that day</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bEUeu5p7iGkimwKDx7WXOFmIVJ6-nmUu9iRRSOrr5h0/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Here’s a copy of the sheet</a> if you want to try it.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-works">Why it Works</h2>
<p>It works because it’s simple yet effective. There are a few principles I’ve followed.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Build flexibility in</strong>: one habit is “Getting up by alarm”, not “Get up at 6 am”, which lets me progressively move my getting up time earlier. It also means I can get up at a different time on the weekend</li>
  <li><strong>Habits are complementary</strong>: if I get up early, I likely have time to meditate. If I don’t drink the night before, I’m more likely to get up early. If I sleep well, I’m more likely to exercise, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Habits focus on the positive</strong>: I track Alcohol Free (AF) days, instead of days I drink</li>
  <li><strong>Habits are limited in number</strong>: I have four habits for now, I think that might even be one too many, these are the ones I want to focus on</li>
  <li><strong>Habits are not overly prescriptive</strong>: I want to make sure I exercise regularly. I have a marathon training plan in <a href="https://www.runna.com/">Runna</a>, which can be used for much more specific tracking, so I want to keep it simple here</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll update later in the year on how I get on, let’s see if I need to add a habit of writing consistently too.</p>

<h2 id="additional-thoughts">Additional Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in forming and sticking to new habits I recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear.</p>

<p>I tried some other MacOS desktop widgets but had a similar experience to the iOS apps. One app I liked was <a href="https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/">Geektool</a> to show the Google Sheet permanently on my desktop. It’s a cool tool, but I did’t really like how it looked. I could vibe code a frontend, but that really isn’t necessary, as the sheet is helping me track things nicely.</p>
