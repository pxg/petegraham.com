I've been writing more markdown in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) lately. I've been mainly writing documentation and TIL posts like this one. I've been wondering if there's a quick way to see the rendered output without leaving the editor.

Turns out Cursor, like VS Code it's based on, has markdown preview built right in **`Cmd+Shift+V`** (Mac) / **`Ctrl+Shift+V`** (Windows/Linux) opens the markdown preview in the current tab. You can also right-click in a markdown file and choose *Open Preview* from the context menu.

This also led me to discover that [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has its own flavour of markdown—extensions like wikilinks, tags, and block references that work great within Obsidian but don't render the same way in standard markdown preview. Something to keep in mind when moving notes between tools.
