I've been writing more markdown in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) lately. I've been mainly writing documentation and TIL posts like this one. I've been wondering if there's a quick way to see the rendered output without leaving the editor.

Turns out Cursor (like VS Code it's based on) has markdown preview built right in **`Cmd+Shift+V`** (Mac) / **`Ctrl+Shift+V`** (Windows/Linux) opens the markdown preview in the current tab. You can also right-click in a markdown file and choose *Open Preview* from the context menu.
