I do a lot of planning and note taking in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Occasionally, some of my notes get a bit long and benefit from being broken up into multiple files. When I do this, I like to link the notes to avoid extracting the information and forgetting about it.

This can be done manually, but there's a handy Obsidian plugin that makes it easier. This can be installed by going to *Settings > Community plugins*, then searching for "Note Refactor" and installing it.

Once installed, it's simple to extract a note:
- Highlight the section of the note you want to extract
- Click `CMD + P` 
- Select *"Note Refactor: Extract selection to new note - first line as file name"* from the menu

A new file will be created based on the first line of your extracted section, this note will open, and a link to it will be added to the original.
