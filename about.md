<!-- # Hi I'm Pete Graham 👋 -->

Most engineering teams can build an MVP, but few are structured to scale beyond a Series A investment, especially in highly regulated sectors like *FinTech, InsurTech, and HealthTech*.

I bridge the gap between *technology strategy* and business scaling. As a Fractional CTO, I ensure your technology doesn't just work—it supports the next 10x of your business growth.

**How I help:**
* *Investor Readiness & Due Diligence:* Having performed over 50 technical due diligence deals, I have developed deep pattern matching for the architectural mistakes that kill deals. I help founders avoid the common pitfalls that blocks funding rounds.
* *Bridging Technology & Business Strategy:* I translate technology strategy into business outcomes, ensuring your architecture and technology choices support your scaling goals.
* *Developing High-Performing Engineering Teams:* I provide the leadership needed to navigate high-growth phases, improving velocity and engineering culture without adding unnecessary corporate overhead.

**I'm brought in when:**
* *You’re scaling a regulated product* and need to ensure your technical foundations meet both performance and compliance standards.
* *Technical debt is slowing you down* your engineering team wants to move fast, but is struggling to deliver on the product roadmap.
* *The "AI Hangover" is real:* you launched an LLM-based feature for a demo, and now it needs to be turned into a robust, cost-effective, and secure production system.

I don't just offer high-level advice; I provide the pragmatic, hands-on leadership required to scale technology and business in sync.

**Next Steps:**

I offer a *30-day Technical Audit* for teams preparing for scale or investment. We'll identify the debt holding you back and build a roadmap to fix it.

**Email [pete@petegraham.co.uk](mailto:pete@petegraham.co.uk) to discuss your current scaling challenges.**
