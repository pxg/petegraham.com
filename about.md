  <p>Hi, I'm Pete Graham.</p>
  <p>
    I'm a fractional CTO who helps companies shape technical strategy and build high-performing engineering teams.
    I've advised teams from a single developer to organizations of more than a hundred, improving practices and delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through my work with <a href="https://www.seedcloud.com/">Seedcloud</a>, I've been involved in over fifty technical due diligence
    engagements for major PE and VC firms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I was CTO at <a href="https://www.zerodeposit.com">Zero Deposit</a> and <a href="https://roomix.com">Roomix</a>.
    My background is in software development, and I'm particularly interested in the overlap between business, technology,
    and customer experience.
