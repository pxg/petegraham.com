Most engineering teams can build an MVP, but few are structured to scale beyond a Series A investment, especially in highly regulated sectors like **FinTech, InsurTech, and HealthTech**.

I bridge the gap between **technology strategy** and business scaling. As a Fractional CTO, I ensure your technology doesn't just work—it supports the next 10x of your business growth.

**How I help:**

* **Investor Readiness & Due Diligence:** Having performed over 50 technical due diligence deals, I have developed deep **pattern matching** for the architectural mistakes that kill deals. I help founders **avoid the common pitfalls** that blocks funding rounds.
* **Bridging Technology & Business Strategy:** I translate **technology strategy** into business outcomes, ensuring your architecture and technology choices support your scaling goals.
* **Developing High-Performing Engineering Teams:** I provide the leadership needed to navigate high-growth phases, improving velocity and engineering culture without adding unnecessary corporate overhead.

**I'm typically brought in when:**

* You’re scaling a regulated product and need to ensure your technical foundations meet both performance and compliance standards.
* Your engineering team is moving fast, but technical debt is starting to slow down feature delivery and product roadmap execution.
* The "AI Hangover" is real: you launched an LLM-based feature for a demo, and now it needs to be turned into a robust, cost-effective, and secure production system.

I don't just offer high-level advice; I provide the pragmatic, hands-on leadership required to scale technology and business in sync.

**The Next Step:**
I offer a **30-day Technical Audit** for teams preparing for scale or investment. We'll identify the debt holding you back and build a roadmap to fix it.
